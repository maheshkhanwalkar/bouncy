# bouncy

## Description

Basic bouncing balls simulation built using SDL3. It randomly initializes balls, setting its size and mass, and an initial velocity. The balls can
collide with each other and the walls, which changes the balls' velocity, according to elastic collision physics.

### How to "play"
* Press '+' to add in a ball (restricted to max limit)
* Press '-' to remove a ball
* Press ESC to quit (or just close the window)
